# predict-macrotrends
It is common knowledge that cryptocurrency market and stock market correlate—ã with each other. Knowing this information, I had an idea for my pet project. To understand the macroeconomic trend, it is necessary to analyze the American debt market and production indicators of the entire economy. To do this, I conducted an analysis and found all the macroeconomic indicators that are harbingers of recession and crises. For example, this is the spread between ten-year bonds and two-year ones.  In the end, I created machine learning models that were based on predictive regression using the meta fbprophet library. They made a forecast for all indicators and built a predictive graph. Based on the forecasts for the debt market, it was possible to make a forecast for the stock market and, consequently, predict the trend on bitcoin.
